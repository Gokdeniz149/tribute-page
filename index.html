        <h2>Here's a time line of Nicola Tesla's life:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1856</strong> - Born on July 10th in Smiljan, Croatia (then part of the Austrian Empire)</li>
            <li><strong>1875</strong> - Enrolled at the Austrian Polytechnic in Graz, Austria to study electrical engineering</li>
            <li><strong>1881</strong> - Moved to Budapest and worked for the Central Telegraph Office</li>
            <li><strong>1882</strong> - Developed the concept of the rotating magnetic field, which is the basis for most AC machinery</li>
            <li><strong>1884</strong> - Emigrated to the United States and began working for Thomas Edison in New York City</li>
            <li><strong>1887</strong> - Patented the induction motor and other devices that used alternating current (AC)</li>
            <li><strong>1891</strong> - Became a naturalized citizen of the United States and invented the Tesla coil, which is still used in radio technology today</li>
            <li><strong>1893</strong> - Demonstrated wireless transmission of electricity at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago</li>
            <li><strong>1899</strong> - Conducted experiments in Colorado Springs, where he claimed to have received signals from outer space</li>
            <li><strong>1901-1905</strong> - Worked on the Wardenclyffe Tower project, an early wireless transmission station, but it was never completed due to financial difficulties</li>
            <li><strong>1917</strong> - The Wardenclyffe Tower was demolished during World War I for its scrap metal</li>
            <li><strong>1934</strong> - Awarded the Edison Medal by the American Institute of Electrical Engineers for his contributions to electrical engineering</li>
            <li><strong>1943</strong> - Died on January 7th in New York City at the age of 86. Despite his many contributions to science and technology, he died penniless and alone.</li>
        </ul>
